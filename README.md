# Vanilla Snake

Vanilla snake is an exercise of sorts - to see if I can create a super-simpl snake-game with my basic knowledge of CSS, HTML and Javascript.
The name comes from the fact that it is written in vanilla javascript - no extra libraries or frameworks of any sort.

Definitely not the best - but OK for a first try!

As a learning developer at the start of my journey, any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated.
