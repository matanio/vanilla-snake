# Vanilla Snake

Vanilla snake is an exercise of sorts - to see if I can create a snake-game with my knowledge of CSS, HTML and Javascript.
The name comes from the fact that it is written in vanilla javascript - no extra libraries or frameworks of any sort.

There are still some features I would like to implement, but works OK for a first try!

As a learning developer, any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated.
